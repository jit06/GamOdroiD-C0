# GamOdroiD-C0
This repository hosts source files and some configuration files I used to build my GamOdroiD C0, a homemade portable retrogaming console based on Odroid C0 and custom 3d printed case.

More detail and how I built it on my blog : http://www.bluemind.org/gamodroid-c0-odroid-based-portable-retrogaming

The first version was based on debian (the content of source directory should be places in /root/GameOdroid directory before launching install.sh)
Now, the console runs a custom build of retroarch, that you can found on my github : https://github.com/jit06/retroarch_fbdev_c1
