# GamOdroiD-C0
This repository hosts source files and some configuration files I used to build my GamOdroiD C0, a homemade portable retrogaming console based on Odroid C0 and custom 3d printed case.

More detail and how I built it on my blog : http://www.bluemind.org/gamodroid-c0-odroid-based-portable-retrogaming

Sources should be places in /root/GameOdroid directory before launching install.sh
